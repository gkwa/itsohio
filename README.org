** motivation:

I see lots of php running sql in loops and I look the other way in
disgust.

Here's me trying to put money where my mouth is and see if I can avoid
looping.

** purpose: learn to use gorm properly

Learning the characteristics of batch inserting.

** tests

Fiddling with batch size
#+begin_example
rm -f *.sqlite
make && time ./itsohio test1
make && time ./itsohio test2
make && time ./itsohio test3
make && time ./itsohio test4
make && time ./itsohio test4 --batch-size 8000 --user-count 50000 -vv
#+end_example
