** purpose: learn to use gorm properly

Learning the characteristics of batch inserting to avoid sql in loops.

** motivation

I see lots of php running sql in loops and I look the other way in
disgust.

Here's me trying to put money where my mouth is and look at what kind
of work is required to avoid sql in loops.

** tests
*** iterating

Not too interesting...mostly learning to setup cobra-cli project
properly and how to use gorm logging.

Fiddling with batch size
#+begin_example
rm -f *.sqlite
make && time ./itsohio test1
make && time ./itsohio test2
make && time ./itsohio test3
#+end_example

*** test4
**** small batch size, small user count

This is helpful to see whats happeing, there is small batch size and
small user count.
#+begin_example
make && time ./itsohio test4
#+end_example

**** large user count falls over: too slow in loop

#+begin_example
make && time ./itsohio test4 --batch-size 8000 --user-count 50000 -vv
#+end_example
